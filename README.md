# RAG for PDF query




## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Introduction

RAG is a method designed to address knowledge-intensive tasks, particularly in information retrieval. It combines an information retrieval component with a text generator model to achieve adaptive and efficient knowledge processing. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining the entire model for knowledge updates, RAG allows for fine-tuning and modification of internal knowledge without extensive retraining.

### Workflow

1. **Input**: RAG takes multiple pdf as input.
2. **VectoreStore**: The pdf's are then converted to vectorstore using FAISS and all-MiniLM-L6-v2 Embeddings model from Hugging Face.
3. **Memory**: Conversation buffer memory is used to maintain a track of previous conversation which are fed to the llm model along with the user query.
4. **Text Generation with GPT-3.5 Turbo**: The embedded input is fed to the GPT-3.5 Turbo model from the OpenAI API, which produces the final output.
5. **User Interface**: Streamlit is used to create the interface for the application.



## Project Features

1. **User-friendly Interface**: User friendly interface for interacting with pdf.

2. **Seamless Navigation**: Reducing complexity and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Getting Started

To use the PDF Intelligence System:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumitdwivedi/rag_PDF.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create .env file and add key OPENAI_API_KEY="" and add openai api key

4. Run the application.
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the user interface.

## Future Enhancement

Need to implement databases for storing the documents and creating knowledge graph, Now this rag has functionality of reading PDF file we can extend it to doc, html etc.
List of previous ocnversations could be added for better user interactions
We can create API Endpoints using Flask, FastAPi or express.js instead of streamlit application interface
